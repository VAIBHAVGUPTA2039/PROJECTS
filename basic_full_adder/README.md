# Basic 4 bit Full Adder
## About

The main aim of this project was to get familiar with VCS and verdi, and use commands to interact with Xilinx Vivado rather than using the GUI. This was necessary because the simulation of the design files was done using VCS and Verdi, meaning that the only role left for Xilinx Vivado is the Synthesis, Implementation, and to generate the bitstream for the specific part using the design files and the constraint file (.sdc)

## About the Files and Structure
I have decided to follow a specific structure for each of my Projects, this was Suggested to me by ChatGPT, this is necessary to ensure a clean folder layout for easy communication between the different tools and to ensure readiblity later on. The file structure is as described below

- src: This folder consists of my src files meaning my design files
- tb: This folder consists of my testbench files
- sim: This folder contain my .fsdb and simv file generated by VCS and used by Verdi

## Workflow
I followed the following steps to work with the different tools

1. First write the design and testbench files using a test editor, may it be gedit or vi editor.
2. Compile and generate executable using the following command
```
vcs -full64 src/4_bit_full_adder.v tb/4_bit_full_adder_tb.v -o sim/simv -lca -kdb -debug_access+all
```
	-full64 : Running on 64bit system
	-o : Specify output directory/file_name
	-lca : Limited Customer Availability, other case is general availability meaning multiple people can change/access the file but here we dont need to generalize it
	-kdb : Enable creation of kdb file (Knoweldge Data Base) during creation (Used for debugging and analysis)
	-debug-access+all : Meaning that we should be able to access all the signals in the modules and submodules even.
 
3. Run the simv file using sim/simv
4. The .fsdb file is generated which is opened in verdi using
```
verdi -ssf sim/*.fsdb -nologo
the .fsdb file here is generated from running ./simv (simv generated using VCS)
-ssf : Source Signal Format
```
