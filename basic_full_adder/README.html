        <h1 id="basic-4-bit-full-adder">Basic 4 bit Full Adder</h1>
        <h2 id="about">About</h2>
        <p>The main aim of this project was to get familiar with Synopsys VCS and Verdi, and to learn how to use command-line workflows with Xilinx Vivado instead of relying on its GUI. In this setup:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>VCS and Verdi are used for simulation and debugging.</li>
        <li>Vivado is used only for synthesis, implementation, and bitstream generation for the target FPGA device.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="about-the-files-and-structure">About the Files and Structure</h2>
        <p>I’ve decided to follow a consistent folder structure across all projects. This ensures a clean and maintainable layout, simplifies tool integration, and improves readability later on.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>src: This folder consists of my src files meaning my design files</li>
        <li>tb: This folder consists of my testbench files</li>
        <li>sim: This folder contain my .fsdb and simv file generated by VCS and used by Verdi</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="workflow">Workflow</h2>
        <p>I followed the following steps to work with the different tools</p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li><h3 id="write-design-and-testbench-files">Write design and testbench files</h3>
        First write the design and testbench files using a test editor, may it be gedit or vi editor.</li>
        <li><h3 id="compile-and-generate-the-simulation-executable">Compile and generate the simulation executable</h3>
        Compile and generate executable using the following command</li>
        </ol>
        <pre><code>vcs -full64 src/4_bit_full_adder.v tb/4_bit_full_adder_tb.v -o sim/simv -lca -kdb -debug_access+all
            -full64 : Running on 64bit system
            -o : Specify output directory/file_name
            -lca : Limited Customer Availability, other case is general availability meaning multiple people can change/access the file but here we dont need to generalize it
            -kdb : Enable creation of kdb file (Knoweldge Data Base) during creation (Used for debugging and analysis)
            -debug-access+all : Meaning that we should be able to access all the signals in the modules and submodules even.</code></pre>
        <ol start="3" type="1">
        <li><h3 id="run-the-simulation">Run the simulation</h3>
        Run the simv file using:</li>
        </ol>
        <pre><code>sim/simv</code></pre>
        <ol start="4" type="1">
        <li><h3 id="open-waveform-in-verdi">Open waveform in Verdi</h3>
        The .fsdb file is generated which is opened in verdi using</li>
        </ol>
        <pre><code>verdi -ssf sim/*.fsdb -nologo
        the .fsdb file here is generated from running ./simv (simv generated using VCS)
        -ssf : Source Signal Format</code></pre>
        <h2 id="what-i-learned">What I learned</h2>
        <p>This project helped me understand</p>
        <ul>
        <li>How to compile, simulated and debug Verilog Code using vcs and Verdi</li>
        <li>How to work with Vivado purely through the command line for synthesis and bitstream generation.</li>
        <li>How to use git for version control, and the importance of maintaining a consistent project directory structure for tool interoperability</li>
        </ul>
