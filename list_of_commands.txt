Below command to compile the verilog file and generate the simulation file simv
>>> vcs -full64 src/4_bit_full_adder.v tb/4_bit_full_adder_tb.v -o sim/simv -lca -kdb -debug_access+all
-full64 : Running on 64bit system
-o : Specify output directory/file_name
-lca : Limited Customer Availability, other case is general availability meaning multiple people can change/access the file but here we dont need to generalize it
-kdb : Enable creation of kdb file (Knoweldge Data Base) during creation (Used for debugging and analysis)
-debug-access+all : Meaning that we should be able to access all the signals in the modules and submodules even 

Below command to open waveform using verdi
>>> verdi -ssf sim/*.fsdb -nologo 
the .fsdb file here is generated from running ./simv (simv generated using VCS)
-ssf : Source Signal Format
